Recognize rhombuses, rectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.\n\nGrade 4: \nCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.G.A.1\nDraw points, lines, line segments, rays, angles (right, acute, obtuse), and perpendicular and parallel lines. Identify these in two-dimensional figures.\n\nCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.4.G.A.3\nRecognize a line of symmetry for a two-dimensional figure as a line across the figure such that the figure can be folded along the line into matching parts. Identify line-symmetric figures and draw lines of symmetry.\n\nGrade 5: \nCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.G.A.2\nRepresent real world and mathematical problems by graphing points in the first quadrant of the coordinate plane, and interpret coordinate values of points in the context of the situation.\n\nCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.5.G.B.3\nUnderstand that attributes belonging to a category of two-dimensional figures also belong to all subcategories of that category. For example, all rectangles have four right angles and squares are rectangles, so all squares have four right angles.\n\nGrade 6: \nCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.6.G.A.3\nDraw polygons in the coordinate plane given coordinates for the vertices; use coordinates to find the length of a side joining points with the same first coordinate or the same second coordinate. Apply these techniques in the context of solving real-world and mathematical problems.\n\nGrade 7: \nCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.G.A.2\nDraw (freehand, with ruler and protractor, and with technology) geometric shapes with given conditions. Focus on constructing triangles from three measures of angles or sides, noticing when the conditions determine a unique triangle, more than one triangle, or no triangle.","popularityrank":123,"popularityrank_pre":999,"popularityrank_25":69,"popularityrank_middle":101,"popularityrank_high":86,"launch_url":"http://code.org/api/hour/begin_learn/kano_pixel_hack","contact":null,"shortdescription":"Code your way through iconic images from video game history, from Tetris through Minecraft!"},{"id":236,"displayweight":1261,"displayweight_pre":1,"displayweight_25":1,"displayweight_middle":1261,"displayweight_high":1,"code":"tt_aqueducts","name":"Aqueducts","orgname":"Terminal Two, Endless","url":"http://terminaltwo.com/hourofcode/aqueducts","longdescription":"In this puzzle game, you're the hero bringing water back to your village!

Use strategies such as counting on; making ten (e.g., 8 + 6 = 8 + 2 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14); decomposing a number leading to a ten (e.g., 13 – 4 = 13 – 3 – 1 = 10 – 1 = 9); using the relationship between addition and subtraction (e.g., knowing that 8 + 4 = 12, one knows 12 – 8 = 4); and creating equivalent but easier or known sums (e.g., adding 6 + 7 by creating the known equivalent 6 + 6 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13). 1.G.A.1 - Distinguish between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size); build and draw shapes to possess defining attributes. Grade 2: NBT.A.4 - Compare two three-digit numbers based on meanings of the hundreds, tens, and ones digits, using \u003e, =, and \u003c symbols to record the results of comparisons. 2.NBT.A.1 - Understand that the three digits of a three-digit number represent amounts of hundreds, tens, and ones. 2.MD.A.1 - Measure the length of an object by selecting and using appropriate tools such as rulers, yardsticks, meter sticks, and measuring tapes. 2.OA.A.1 - Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions 2.G.A.1 - Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes, such as a given number of angles or a given number of equal faces. Identify triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and cubes. Grade 3: 3.NF.A.3.D - Compare two fractions with the same numerator or the same denominator by reasoning about their size. Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with the symbols \u003e, =, or \u003c, and justify the conclusions, e.g., by using a visual fraction model. 3.NF.A.3 - Explain equivalence of fractions in special cases, and compare fractions by reasoning about their size. 3.MD.B.4 - Generate measurement data by measuring lengths using rulers marked with halves and fourths of an inch. Show the data by making a line plot, where the horizontal scale is marked off in appropriate units— whole numbers, halves, or quarters. 3.NF.A.3 - Explain equivalence of fractions in special cases, and compare fractions by reasoning about their size. 3.G.A.1 - Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and others) may share attributes (e.g., having four sides), and that the shared attributes can define a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses, rectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories. Grade 4: 4.NF.A.2 - Compare two fractions with different numerators and different denominators, e.g., by creating common denominators or numerators, or by comparing to a benchmark fraction such as 1/2. Recognize that comparisons are valid only when the two fractions refer to the same whole. Record the results of comparisons with symbols \u003e, =, or \u003c, and justify the conclusions. 4.NBT.B.4/​5 - Fluently add and subtract multi-digit whole numbers using the standard algorithm. 4.G.A.2 - Classify two-dimensional figures based on the presence or absence of parallel or perpendicular lines, or the presence or absence of angles of a specified size. Recognize right triangles as a category, and identify right triangles. Grade 5: 5.NBT.A.3 - Read, write, and compare decimals to thousandths. 5.MD.B.2 - Make a line plot to display a data set of measurements in fractions of a unit (1/2, 1/4, 1/8). Use operations on fractions for this grade to solve problems involving information presented in line plots. 5.NBT.B.7 - Add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimals to hundredths, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction; relate the strategy to a written method and explain the reasoning used. 5.G.B.3 - Understand that attributes belonging to a category of two-dimensional figures also belong to all subcategories of that category. For example, all rectangles have four right angles and squares are rectangles, so all squares have four right angles.","popularityrank":165,"popularityrank_pre":999,"popularityrank_25":168,"popularityrank_middle":295,"popularityrank_high":235,"launch_url":"http://code.org/api/hour/begin_learn/coding_roboblockly","contact":null,"shortdescription":"RoboBlockly is designed for beginners to learn coding and math with robots.
